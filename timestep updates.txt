Observations from Updating the time steps in simulations

Case 1: 

set initial conditions to true for both nodes A and B. 
mode = synchronous
outputs a cycle of length 4 starting at index 0.

we get a similar result when the initial conditions are changed to either false or random values (for both nodes and also in the case where we set one node to specific value T/F and other random) 

Case 2:

set initial conditions to true for both nodes A and B
mode = asynchronous
no cycles were detected. 

every time the simulation is ran, obtained different graphs. 

Case 3: 

set initial conditions to random for both the nodes. 
mode = asynchronous
outputs different length of cycles each time.
