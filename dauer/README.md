## 1. Simulations

File: print_states.ipynb

simulate the system under favourable (cmk-1=1, ncr=1, pher=0) and unfavourable (cmk-1=0, ncr=0, pher=1) conditions using asynchronous update. Perform perturbation experiments to emulate daf-c and daf-d mutant conditions. 


## 2. Stable motif Analysis

File: Stablemotifs.ipynb

Extract attractors and stable motifs. Identify driver nodes for a specific target to control the attractors. 


## 3. Logic backbone

File: logic_bb.ipynb

Identify subgraphs from signals to motif nodes and motif nodes to output nodes. Generating reduced boolean model by assigning causal logic to the edges.
