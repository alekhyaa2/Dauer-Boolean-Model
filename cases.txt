when pheromone = false
      dauer = 1
      pheromone = 0
      daf-2 = 0

when pheromone = True
      dauer = 1
      pheromone = 1
      daf-2 = 0
because daf-16 is staying at 1, system always converges to dauer. 

daf-16 *= (daf-12 or daf-18 or daf-28 or ftt-2 or ifta-2 or swi-snf or daf-5) or 
(not ins-7 or not par-5 or not akt or not rle-1 or not tax-4 or not tph-1 or not hlh-30 or not odr-3)

Checking which of the daf-16 regulators is leading to dauer. 
simulating with steps = 200 for repeat = 100
daf-28 = 0
daf-18 = 0
daf-12 = 0
ifta-2 = 1
ftt-2 = 1
swi-snf = 1
daf-5 = 1

ins-7 = 0
par-5 = 1
akt = 0
rle-1 = close to 0.5
tax-4 = 0
tph-1 = 0
hlh-30 = close to 0.5
odr-3 = 1

for all the regulators that are freely connected ( which means these nodes are not connected to any other nodes except daf-16 in the network), find out if they all 
together regulate daf-16 or can individually cause effects to the state of daf-16. 
For example - ifta-2, ftt-2, swi-snf, are positively regulating daf-16. So should they work together or individually? 
similarly for negative regulators - rle-1, hlh-30, par-5 ??
should these nodes be grouped and connected by different connectors (And/or) ??
ifta-2,ftt-2 has to be 0 for daf-16 to be 0 
swi-snf is required for daf-16 functions like dauer formation. So, swi-snf needs to be 0 for daf-16 to be 0. 
daf-18 should be 1 to rescue from dauer. 
also check daf-18 and daf-2

even with ftt- = ifta-2 = swi-snf = false and pheromone = false and daf-18 = true, dauer = 1. 

from the small simulations we ran, we know for sure that the system needs initial conditions to allow it to converge to a specific node. with random conditions, system always converges to dauer.
